# League of Legends Classification

**Author**: [Eric Wehmueller](mailto:ericwehmueller@gmail.com)

## Overview

This project is the third project for Flatiron School's bootcamp program in Data Science.  We are being placed into a hypothetical situation as a Data Scientist and hoping to provide value to our business for the scenario we are given.

## Business Problem

I have been hired by the esports organization Cloud9 as a player coach/analyst for the professional League of Legends team.  They are competing at the top level and are looking to win every game they possibly can, as there is a lot of money on the line.  My job is to help them determine the most important factors in winning League of Legends games.  I am to investigate what should I be advising our players to focus on in the first 10 minutes of each game to provide the highest chance to win the game.

## Project Deliverables

* A GitHub repository
* A Jupyter Notebook
* A non-technical presentation


## Project Summary

I devised these questions that I believed could be answered through data analysis.
***
* 1. What is the single most important determining factor in winning a game?
* 2. What objectives should our players prioritize?
* 3. What objectives should our players ignore?
***

I explore this thoroughly in the league-analysis.ipynb file contained within this repository via classification modeling.
